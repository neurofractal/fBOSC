function [pv,meanpower]=eBOSC_bgfit_robust(F,B)
%
% This function estimates the background power spectrum via a
% linear regression fit to the power spectrum in log-log coordinates
% 
% parameters:
% F - vector containing the sampled frequencies (i.e. potentially removing any unwanted frequency peaks)
% B - matrix containing power as a function of the frequencies stated in F (rows) and
% time). This is the time-frequency data.
%
% returns:
% pv = contains the slope and y-intercept of regression line
% meanpower = mean power values at each frequency 
%

b = robustfit(log10(F),mean(log10(B),2)');
pv(1) = b(2);
pv(2) = b(1);

% transform back to natural units (power; usually uV^2/Hz)
meanpower=10.^(polyval(pv,log10(F)));
